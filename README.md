### __What data you’ll use and where you’ll get it?__ ###

After some deliberation our group has decided to select the “Population Estimates and Projections” data set provided by The World Bank. This data set contains an extensive list of data points from different groups consisting of age, gender, location, death rate, life expectancy, percentage of working class, as well as percentage of both rural and urban communities. With this extensive list we expect to have a multitude of questions and ways to visualize the data. Additionally, it is important to note that this data is open to the public and has a considerable amount of projected data that is missing, including but not limited to countries without any data and projected death rates.

### __Questions or Problems for Investigation__ ### 

The main problem we would like to address is understanding the global trends of  the population at large. We want to investigate trends based on continents, regions, and communities to see the ways in which they are projected to change within the next 30 years. Further investigation could also be done in previous years to understand the changes over the past few decades and how they differ from the projected changes in the future. 

Here are a couple of the questions we would like to answer:

1. Does the overall population increase or decrease with time, as well as specifically if certain nations or regions are increasing or decreasing in population growth?
  
2. How have projections changed given the rise of global issues, and how have previous issues impacted projections?
	This type of question also requires additional data/understanding that may not be present in the dataset, but can be found through other data sets.

### __Applicable Methods__ ### 

One potential method could be using K-Means Clustering to find similar groups of countries based on some data point or group of datapoints. Another potential method we are discussing would be the inclusion of a machine learning model. Such a model would be used to predict the projected outcomes of any given country in any given year. Another option under the umbrella of machine learning includes using C4.5 to classify different countries based on population trends. 


### __Measurement of Success__ ### 

Success should be measured based on how easily we are able to convey our findings to those unfamiliar to the data. Additionally, if we pursue a machine learning model we will have the ability to have a direct test, given a split between testing and training data, to demonstrate exactly how accurate our model is.
